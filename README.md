##About
I really like the idea of Matchu's Strict Workflow but wanted to make some modifications.

##New Functionality
- nothing finished yet, check back later!

##In Progress
- adding "autowork" which will go straight into work mode after a break.


##Wishlist
- add pause (for bathroom/food breaks and such)...or at least some disable...cause once it starts it ain't stopping.
- add wildcard matching for domains and possibly allowing paths with wildcards
- better site blocking (like whitelist extension) (consider using chrome.tab.remove(tab.id))

##Credits
Like I said, this is all Matchu's work with some of my own tweaks.
